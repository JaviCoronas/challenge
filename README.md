# Micro Service Environment

## Introduction

The project has been developed to pass the technical test presented. It consists of 3 microservices that communicate with each other. The aim is to create a small subscription management structure and to demonstrate some of the knowledge of microservices distributed architectures.

### Public Service

This service publishes all endpoints required for subscription management. It redirects everything that comes to it to the corresponding service.
